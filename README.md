# Project
Predicting Student's Success in Programming Courses: A Decision Support System for Admission in Computer Science and Information Technology Programs (also known as GreenScreen)

# Purpose
The primary purpose of this system is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the admission process for IT/CS programs at WMSU. It aims to:
•	Simplify Application Submission: Allow students to easily register and submit their admission applications online, ensuring that only eligible candidates participate.
•	Predict Academic Success: Utilize a predictive model to assess the likelihood of a student's success in programming-related courses based on their credentials, thus eliminating the need for an interview for well-qualified applicants.
•	Streamline Interview Assignments: Automatically assign interviewers a manageable number of applicants, distribute applications equally, and provide interviewers with comprehensive applicant profiles for evaluation.
•	Automate/Manual Admission Decision: Enable admission officers to automatically or manually accept pre-qualified students based on academic predictions, with the option to toggle this feature as needed.
•	Provide Analytics: Offer an analytical dashboard for admission officers to monitor and gain insights into the admission process, including applicant numbers, pre-qualified applicants, and remaining slots availability.
•	Generate Reports: Allow admission officers to generate printable reports with various filtering options to aid in decision-making and record-keeping.
